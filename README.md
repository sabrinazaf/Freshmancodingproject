# Freshmancodingproject

Welcome to my tamagotchi game! To run the game, just run the file and follow the instructions by writing a name and hitting space. There are no extra modules to download, as all I used was Tkinter, the mousemoution wrapper, the random module, and the file io write and read functions displayed on the website.
